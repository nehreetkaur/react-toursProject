# Description
Created an application , about tours. I got inspired while I
was learning from Freecode camp react tutorial and I have made while I was learning.Created different components and also used the state hook. User can get information about tours and price,also user can read more information by clicking on the show more button. I have learned so many new things and I have used the sameAPI which was used in the tutorial. Big thank you to freecode camp.Also, if user is not interested , can remove the tour from the list and if no tours left in the list user can go back to the tours list to explore them again.
